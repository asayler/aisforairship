A small blog for writing about technology, tech policy, InfoSec, and
engineering in general. Primarily by [Andy Sayler](https://www.andysayler.com),
but perhaps with others writing periodically.

Built using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and [Minimal
Mistakes](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/). Code can be
found in
[asayler/aisforairship](https://github.com/asayler/aisforairship) on
GitHub.

Hosting TBD. Probably a Raspberry Pi. Under the bed.
