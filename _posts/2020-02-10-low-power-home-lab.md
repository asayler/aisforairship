Like many folks who make bad life decisions, I operate a [home
lab](https://www.reddit.com/r/homelab/) filled with server and network
infrastructure. Some of this is so I can do things like operate
over-complicated home network setups, but mostly it's just a chance to
futz around with computers. Hey, everyone needs a hobby.

Because my home lab isn't exactly... critical infrastructure, and because
I'd still like to live on this planet in 20 years, my most recent
home lab overhaul involved optimizing my compute systems for minimal
power consumption while still maintaining reasonable compute
power. While large scale datacenter operators have long prioritized power
efficiency, it's a less explored space at the small-scale, home-lab
level. Thus, I found myself testing and reviewing the power output of
a range of home-lab-scale server platforms, the results of which I
present here in case anyone should find them useful.
