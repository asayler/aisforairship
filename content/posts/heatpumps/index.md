Heat Pumps are one of those delightful technologies that does pretty
much what it says on the tin. They transfer thermal energy (which we
call "heat") from one location to another.[^1] Everyone has
encountered heat pumps in their daily lives: your refrigerator is a
one-way heat pump that transfers heat from the inside of the fridge to
the air in your kitchen. They cool your food, warming your house a bit
in the process. Similarly, an air conditioner is another one-way heat
pump -- it cools a house by pumping heat from the air indoors to the
air outside.

[^1]: There are different kinds of heat pumps. The heat pumps we'll
focus on here are called [air source heat
pumps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_source_heat_pump) because the
medium they are exchanging heat with is the (generally outdoor) air.

Refrigerators and AC units are both heat pumps, but in modern
parlance, we tend to reserve the use of the term "heat pump" for
bidirectional systems -- capable of both heating and cooling depending
on which direction they are run. Modern home heat pumps are a lot like
traditional ACs, but with the capability to run in reverse. As a
result they can pump heat from inside of your house to the outside
(cooling your house), or you can run them backwards to pump heat from
outside your house to the inside (heating your house in the
process). Sometimes, we also use the term "heat pump" for systems that
only run in the heating direction (for example, a heat pump water
heater). Heat pumps that only cool tend to continue to be called air
conditioners (or refrigerators when they are cooling your food rather
than your air). But at the end of the day, refrigerators, ACs, home
heat pumps, and heat pump water heaters are all examples of the same
underlying heat pump principle. They consume energy to move heat from
one location to another.

# And I care, why?

It turns out that if we want to continue to live on this planet
indefinitely, we really need to stop burning fossil fuels. One of the
main uses of fossil fuels today is home heating. In the Western United
States this takes the form of the ubiquitous gas furnace -- which
burns natural gas in order to heat your home in the winter. Even if we
succeed in converting all electrical generation capacity to non-fossil
fuel means, the use of fossil fuels in home heating (and cooking, but
that's a topic for another day) will continue to contribute
unsustainable greenhouse gas emissions to our atmosphere.

If we can't keep heating our homes by burning fossil fuels, what are
the alternatives? If you live in very specific places, you could tap
the Earth's geothermal energy.[^2] But this option is very expansive
and extremely limited it where it can be applied. We could go back to
burning trees (or other organic matter) for home heat, the way our
ancestors did, but that requires a lot of work and raises somewhat
significant air quality and fire safety concerns. We could design
homes to use passive solar heating, which is great, but again, is
limited to specific locations.

[^2]: Some people use the term "geothermal energy" to refer to [ground
source heat
pumps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ground_source_heat_pump). Ground
source heat pumps are heat pumps that use the relatively constant
temperature of the ground (once you dig down 5-10 feet) as a thermal
reservoir that they can pump heat to/from. This is quite different
from the traditional use of the "geothermal energy" term that refers
to using highly heated water from geothermally active parts of the
Earth to drive electrical turbines or heat buildings.

If we want a generally applicable, reasonably practical home heating
method that doesn't burn fossil fuels, we're going to need to use
electricity to heat our homes. There are two ways to do that. The
naive way is electrical resistance heating: basically running a lot of
electrical current through small wires causing them to heat up. This
is very simple and very expensive. While electrical resistant heaters
are technically 100% efficient (all of the electricity they consume is
being turned into heat), turning a high-quality energy like
electricity directly into a low-quality energy like heat is rarely
economically advantageous.

To demonstrate, look at the cost differences for electricity (a
high-quality form of energy) and natural gas (a low-quality form of
energy). At the moment, electricity in Boulder, CO costs residential
users somewhere in the range of $0.10 to $0.20 per kWh including taxes
and fees. Meanwhile, natural gas costs roughly $1/therm. 1 therm is
equivalent to 29 kWh, which means the price of gas is roughly $0.03
per kWh, or about one fifth the median electrical price of $0.15 per
kWh. So sure, we could use electrical resistance heating to heat our
homes, but we'd increase heating costs by roughly 5x.

Fortunately there's the less naive way to heat with electricity -- use
a heat pump. While electrical resistance heating turns 100% of the
electricity expended into heat, heat pumps do us one better -- they
provide more heat than the energy they consume. Rather than being a
blatant violation of the first law of thermodynamics, this is really
just a clever abuse of system boundaries. Rather than convert
electricity to heat, heat pumps use electricity to move heat that
already exists around. As a result, it is not uncommon to find heat
pumps that provide "efficiencies" in the 200% to 400% range (e.g. that
move 2x to 4x as much heat as the energy they consume). That goes a
long ways to cutting into the cost advantage of natural gas, and puts
us in the range of being able to heat homes using electricity for
roughly the same cost as heating a home using fossil fuels (and in
places where expensive fuels like heating oil are used, heat pumps are
often quite a bit cheaper).

# Heat Pumps in Practice

This all sounds nice in theory, but what does it look like in
practice? Can air source heat pumps handle places with cold winters?
How can you pump heat from sub-freezing outdoor air?

In 2020, we replaced the 20-year-old gas furnace (as well as an aging
traditional central AC unit) in our 1999-construction home with a
cold-weather rated Mitsubishi multi-zone Hyper-Heat heat pump. The
installed system consisted of an MXZ-4C36NAHZ 36K BTU outdoor
compressor, an SVZ-KP18 18K BTU central air handler (to replace the
old furnace) and two SLZ-KF09 9K BTU ceiling-mounted mini-split heads
for the upstairs bedrooms. This system has a number of desirable
qualities:

* It replaces the old furnace and AC air exchange with the SVZ-KP18
  central air handler, allowing us to reuse the home's existing
  single-zone duct-work to heat and cool the common areas of the home.
* It adds SLZ-KF09 individually-controllable mini-split heads to the
  upstairs bedrooms, allowing these rooms to have their HVAC
  controlled as separate zones from the rest of the house. These units
  also do a far better job cooling the previously too-warm upstairs
  than the central duct-work ever did.

* resiliency and risk
