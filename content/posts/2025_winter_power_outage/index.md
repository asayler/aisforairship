Turns out planned power outages are becoming the new normal. Following
Boulder's [April2024 outage](/posts/2024_spring_power_outage/), we
almost made it through 2025 without a repeat. But it was not to be --
a combination of dry weather and high winds led to not one, but two,
public safety power shutoffs the week of Monday, December 15th, 2025.
In total, these outages led to over 57 hours without power over the
course of four days.

I [previously wrote](/posts/2024_spring_power_outage/) about our
experience during the 2024 outage. revisit that post for details, but in
short -- our home is equipped with ~6.5 kW of solar capacity and ~20
kWh of battery capacity. In theory, that should allow us to run off
grid indefinitely, assuming we get some sun each day and can keep our
base load below 1 kW or so. We we installed this system, we didn't
really expect to ever really need to test this, but it turns out it's
an increasingly relevant capability in the age of rising wildfire risk
and a diminishing desire of utility companies to get sued when they do
cause fires.

We made it through the 28-hour outage in 2024 without ever losing
backup power. But April is much kinder to solar generation that what
was effetely the Winter solstice. The 2025 outage provided us with a
chance to really test out the worst case solar scenario --partial sun
during the shortest days of the year. An since that wasn't enough fun,
we decided to couple it with back-to-back outages less than 24 hours
apart. Wheee!

So how did we fare this time around? Did any of the lessons from the
last outage lead to better outcomes? And what do these increasingly
frequent power shutoffs mean for the future?

# The Timeline

This winter in Boulder has been... somewhat non-existent. From
November through now, we've had almost no snow and temperatures far
above the historic average. But that hasn't stopped Boulder's
increasingly notorious Winter wind storms. Starting on Monday, December
15th, Xcel (the local power company) started sending out notices about
the potential need for a planned power shutoff Wednesday due to an
expect high wind event. This was an improvement over the 2024 outage
where we had less than 24 hours of notice about the planned
shutoff. So cheers to Xcel for heading the feedback that folks need
more of a heads up to plan for these sorts of things.

The shutoff was planned to run from Noon to 6PM on Wednesday. December
17th. From Monday morning through Wednesday morning, we received four
increasingly specific emails about the planned shutoff. The final
email sent Wednesday morning moved the start time of the shutoff up tow
hours to 10AM to account for the wind even starting earlier than expected.
