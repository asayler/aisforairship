A small blog for writing about technology, tech policy, InfoSec, and
engineering in general. Primarily by [Andy Sayler](https://www.andysayler.com),
but perhaps with others writing periodically.

Built using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and
[Ananke theme](https://github.com/theNewDynamic/gohugo-theme-ananke/).
Code can be found in
[asayler/aisforairship](https://github.com/asayler/aisforairship) on
GitHub.

Hosting TBD. Probably a Raspberry Pi. Under the bed.
